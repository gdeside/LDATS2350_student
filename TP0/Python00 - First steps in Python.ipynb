    "# 1. Introduction to Python\n",
    "\n",
    "**Python** is a high-level programming language created by **Guido van Rossum** (a Dutch programmer) and first released in **1991**. Over time, Python has evolved into one of the most popular languages for various applications, including **data mining** and **machine learning**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Python 3?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Two main versions**: Python 2 and Python 3.  \n",
    "- Python 3.0 (released in **December 2008**) introduced significant but **non–backward compatible changes**.  \n",
    "- **Python 2 End of Life**: Officially reached on **January 1, 2020**, meaning no further updates or maintenance.  \n",
    "- **Recommendation**: Always use a recent **Python 3** release for new projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Interpreted Language\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike many languages that require a compilation step (C, C++, Java, etc.), **Python is interpreted**:\n",
    "- Your code is executed directly by an **interpreter**, without creating machine code binaries.\n",
    "- **Faster development cycle**: write code → run immediately → see results.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Open Source Philosophy\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is **open source**, meaning:\n",
    "- Anyone can view and contribute to its source code.\n",
    "- This fosters a **large community** that actively develops libraries, bug fixes, and new features.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Python for Data Mining?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Rich Ecosystem of Libraries**:  \n",
    "   Python offers libraries like **NumPy**, **pandas**, **scikit-learn**, **matplotlib**, and many more. These tools provide powerful functions for data manipulation, statistical analysis, and machine learning, making Python an ideal choice for **data mining** workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Easy to Learn & Use**:  \n",
    "   - The language is renowned for its **readable syntax** and **straightforward** structure.\n",
    "   - Quick to prototype: you can implement data mining algorithms with fewer lines of code, helping you focus on **analysis** rather than low-level details.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Huge Community & Resources**:  \n",
    "   - A large user community offers extensive **tutorials**, **online forums**, and **packages**.  \n",
    "   - Many data mining and machine learning **frameworks** are Python-first or provide strong Python interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Integration & Flexibility**:  \n",
    "   - Python can integrate with databases, web services, and other tools, streamlining end-to-end data mining projects.  \n",
    "   - It supports diverse programming paradigms, including **object-oriented**, **imperative**, and **functional**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python's Object-Oriented Paradigm\n",
    "\n",
    "Although you can program in a procedural style, Python supports **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**:\n",
    "- OOP helps **reduce system complexity** via **reusable** code components.\n",
    "- **Objects** combine data (attributes) and procedures (methods).\n",
    "- These objects are instantiated from **classes**, which define the blueprint of the objects’ data and behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "By combining **object orientation**, an **intuitive syntax**, and a **vast data analysis ecosystem**, **Python** is a powerful and accessible language for **data mining** tasks.\n"

    "## 1.1 Python IDE (Integrated Development Environment)\n",
    "\n",
    "While you can execute Python scripts directly from the command line (e.g., running `python <program>.py`), this approach does not easily scale for **larger projects** or **iterative exploration**—both of which are common in **data mining**. An **IDE (Integrated Development Environment)** or a dedicated code editor is typically preferred to manage projects, navigate code, and debug more effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course, we will make extensive use of **Jupyter Notebook**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Origin**: Jupyter was born from the IPython project in 2014.  \n",
    "- **Structure**: It is a web application based on a **client-server** architecture, allowing you to create and manipulate documents known as *notebooks*.  \n",
    "- **Notebook Features**:  \n",
    "  - A notebook file is composed of *cells* which can be executed **independently** (using `Ctrl+Enter` or `Shift+Enter` to run and move to the next cell).  \n",
    "  - All cells share the **same memory** (namespace). This means if you declare or modify a variable in one cell, you can access it in another cell—provided you run the former before the latter.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use Jupyter Notebooks in Data Mining?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Interactive Data Exploration**:  \n",
    "   Data mining workflows often involve quickly testing ideas, plotting intermediate results, and revising steps. Jupyter's cell-based execution allows you to:\n",
    "   - Tweak data cleaning steps or model parameters on the fly.  \n",
    "   - Immediately visualize results (e.g., with libraries like matplotlib or seaborn).  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Reproducibility and Collaboration**:  \n",
    "   - Notebooks combine **code, outputs, and narrative** (markdown text, equations, etc.) in a single document.  \n",
    "   - This makes it easier to share your data mining process (data preparation, exploratory analysis, modeling, etc.) with others.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Ease of Debugging and Prototyping**:  \n",
    "   - You can isolate segments of logic (data transformation, model fitting) in different cells.  \n",
    "   - If something goes wrong in your data pipeline or model training, only re-run the relevant cell instead of the entire script.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Given these benefits, Jupyter Notebook is particularly well-suited for **iterative, experimental** data mining tasks where **rapid feedback** and **in-code documentation** are essential. Go ahead and **try** executing the cells in the provided notebook to see how variables can be defined in one cell and re-used in another!"

    "\n",
    "We strongly recommend installing **Anaconda** to set up your Python environment. Anaconda is available for the three main operating systems (Linux, Windows, and macOS). It comes with a powerful **package manager** called `conda`, which simplifies the download and installation of additional libraries. (You can also use `pip`, but mixing `pip` and `conda` within the same environment can sometimes lead to dependency conflicts.)\n",

    "## 3. Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "Python syntax **does away with curly braces** (like `{ }`) for code blocks. Instead, it relies on **indentation** to define blocks (e.g., within `if`-`else`, `for` loops, function definitions, etc.). The **colon** (`:`) indicates where a new indentation block starts.\n",

    "1. **Strings**:  \n",

    "2. **Lists**:  \n",
    "   - Create a list of at least 5 elements (mix strings and integers).  \n",
    "   - Replace the 3rd element of the list with something new.  \n",
    "   - Print the modified list.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Tuples**:  \n",
    "   - Define a tuple with exactly 3 elements.  \n",
    "   - Attempt to change one of those elements (handle or display any error message that arises).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Sets**:  \n",
    "   - Create a set that contains at least one string, one integer, and one boolean.  \n",
    "   - Check if a certain element (e.g., a string) is in the set, and print the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Dictionaries**:  \n",
    "   - Create a dictionary that maps **course codes** to **course names** (e.g., `'LDATS2350': \"Data Mining\"`).  \n",
    "   - Print the value associated with `'LDATS2350'`.  \n",
    "   - Add a new key-value pair and print the entire dictionary again.\n",
